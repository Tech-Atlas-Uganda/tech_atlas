## 🎯 Vision & Principles

### Our Vision

Tech Atlas serves as the **definitive, community-owned platform** for Uganda's tech ecosystem. We function as **digital infrastructure** rather than a commercial product, treating ecosystem data as a **public good** that benefits everyone.

### Core Principles

#### 1. 🌍 **Community Ownership**
Tech Atlas belongs to Uganda's tech community. Major decisions are made collectively, and the platform serves the community's interests above all else.

#### 2. 🔓 **Open & Transparent**
All governance processes, decisions, and discussions are open and transparent. Community members can observe and participate in decision-making.

#### 3. 🤝 **Inclusive Participation**
We welcome participation from all members of Uganda's tech ecosystem, regardless of experience level, background, or affiliation.

#### 4. 📊 **Data as Public Good**
Ecosystem data is treated as a public resource. Information is freely accessible and benefits the entire community.

#### 5. 🛡️ **Quality & Integrity**
We maintain high standards for content quality and accuracy through community moderation and verification processes.

#### 6. 🚀 **Sustainable Growth**
We prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term gains, ensuring the platform serves the community for years to come.
