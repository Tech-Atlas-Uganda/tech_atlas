## Problem Statement

### The Challenge

Uganda's technology ecosystem faces a critical **information fragmentation problem**:

1. **Scattered Information**: Data about hubs, communities, startups, jobs, and opportunities is dispersed across:
   - Personal WhatsApp groups
   - Facebook pages
   - Twitter threads
   - Individual websites
   - Word-of-mouth networks

2. **Discovery Barriers**: New entrants struggle to:
   - Find relevant communities and hubs
   - Discover job opportunities
   - Access learning resources
   - Learn about events and opportunities
   - Connect with other professionals

3. **Network Effects**: Opportunities often circulate within closed networks, creating:
   - Unequal access to information
   - Missed opportunities for talented individuals
   - Slower ecosystem growth
   - Reduced collaboration potential

4. **Duplication of Effort**: Multiple organizations maintain separate, incomplete directories

5. **No Single Source of Truth**: No authoritative, up-to-date resource for ecosystem information

### The Impact

This fragmentation results in:
- **Talent Loss**: Skilled professionals leave due to lack of visible opportunities
- **Slow Growth**: Startups struggle to find talent, funding, and resources
- **Reduced Collaboration**: Communities operate in silos
- **Missed Opportunities**: Events, grants, and jobs go unnoticed
- **Inefficient Resource Allocation**: Duplicated efforts and wasted resources

### Architecture Patterns

#### 1. Full-Stack Type Safety

```typescript
// Shared types between frontend and backend
// tRPC ensures end-to-end type safety

// Backend (server/routers.ts)
export const appRouter = router({
  getJobs: publicProcedure
    .input(z.object({ type: z.string().optional() }))
    .query(async ({ input }) => {
      return await db.query.jobs.findMany();
    }),
});

// Frontend (client/src/lib/trpc.ts)
const jobs = trpc.getJobs.useQuery({ type: 'full-time' });
// ✅ Fully typed, autocomplete works, compile-time errors
```

#### 2. Database-First Design

```typescript
// Schema defined in Drizzle ORM
// Migrations generated automatically
// Type-safe queries

export const jobs = pgTable("jobs", {
  id: integer("id").primaryKey().generatedByDefaultAsIdentity(),
  title: varchar("title", { length: 255 }).notNull(),
  // ... more fields
});

export type Job = typeof jobs.$inferSelect;
export type InsertJob = typeof jobs.$inferInsert;
```

#### 3. Component-Based UI

```typescript
// Reusable, composable components
// shadcn/ui for base components
// Custom components for domain logic

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>{job.title}</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <JobDetails job={job} />
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

#### 4. AI Agent Architecture

```typescript
// Gemini with Google Search grounding
// Structured output with JSON schema
// Duplicate prevention
// Error handling

const result = await generateContent({
  model: "gemini-3-flash-preview",
  contents: [{ role: "user", parts: [{ text: prompt }] }],
  tools: [{ googleSearch: {} }],
  generationConfig: {
    responseMimeType: "application/json",
    responseSchema: jobSchema,
  },
});
```
